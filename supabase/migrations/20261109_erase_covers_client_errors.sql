-- Erase coverage grows again: error telemetry (20261109_client_errors.sql)
-- added a per-person table, and "Erase everything" must cover it like
-- every other — a person's error reports carry their scopes, routes and
-- stack traces. (Guest reports have profile_id null; they belong to no
-- one and are not attributable, so they are not — and cannot be — erased
-- by uid.)
--
-- The function is replaced rather than patched (plpgsql cannot append to
-- an existing body); the body is the newest one (20260919, which added
-- push_subscriptions) verbatim plus the client_errors block. Same rules
-- as always: to_regclass guards and auth.uid() scoping.
